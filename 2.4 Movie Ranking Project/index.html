 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Nice Guys (2016)</h3>
 <p>Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe; a very dry, humourous action comedy</p>
 <h3>Interstellar (2014)</h3>
 <p>Mathew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain; a mind bending sci-fi that is shot amazingly</p>
 <h3>Sinners (2025)</h3>
 <p>Michael B. Jordan and Hailee Steinfield; a masterpiece that combines music, action and historical accuracy</p>
