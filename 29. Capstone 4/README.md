Capstone 4 Project

The aim of this project was to select a public API and create a web application utilising it. I've created an app that generates a random note of advice (from https://api.adviceslip.com/) and creates a wallpaper with it.

Dependencies to install:
- "axios"
- "body-parser"
- "ejs"
- "express"
